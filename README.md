# Punk API Beer App

This beer app uses the Punk API to fetch and filter JSON data from BrewDog Brewery's beer database. I used modern JavaScript and SVG images as the filters which allows for more customization and styling than a regular icon would. It is fully responsive with the use of both flexbox and grid.
